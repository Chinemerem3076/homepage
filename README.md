## My process

- I build this project through a step by step process.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles



### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
  width: 100px;
}
```



### Continued development

I want to learn how to use width, height, vh, vw, max-height, max-width.
How to use Git when pushing to github. 



### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.markdownguide.org/) - It helped me alot wg=hen trying to write my Readme.md file. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Example resource 2](https://www.w3schools.com/) - This is an amazing article which helped me to research and get a code to be use while writing a program. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
